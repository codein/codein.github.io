      <description>Robin Varghese What ever the problem, I like to be part of the solution. I thrive in an environment of uncertainty which requires constant learning. I enjoy empowering others in my knowledge space and developing software to surface information from data. Given any problem space, my hope is to be part of the solution. My aspiration is to improve health-care delivery by harnessing my skills.

      <description>This talk looked at Liberty Mutual’s transformation to Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps.
