# i love adirondacks

To assist me in planning a unforgettable getaway with our family and friends, I made a list of some of the best things to do in the Adirondacks.

# Places

Driving up to the top of the Whiteface along the Veterans’ Memorial Highway—New York’s fifth-highest peak at 4,867’—isn’t your typical automotive experience.

A fifteen-minute ride gliding through the air in the awe-inspiring natural beauty of the Adirondack Mountain range, the Cloudsplitter Gondola Ride transports visitors from the base of Whiteface Mountain to the peak of Little Whiteface. At the peak itself, look around and you’ll find yourself surrounded by Lake Placid and Lake Placid Village, Lake Champlain and some of the most massive peaks in all of New York State. Not a bad way to start your day at Whiteface Mountain!

High Falls Gorge is a 22 acre, privately owned nature park. We provide safe trail access for all ages to an otherwise inaccessible area, with four splendid Adirondack waterfalls cascading over rocks into a deep crevice carved a billion years ago. In the shadow of Whiteface Mountain, you can take a nature walk to view the famous AuSable River as it cascades over ancient granite cliffs.
