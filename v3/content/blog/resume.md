# Robin Varghese

What ever the problem, I like to be part of the solution.
I thrive in an environment of uncertainty which requires constant learning.
I enjoy empowering others in my [knowledge space](https://github.com/codein/codein.github.io/blob/master/files/resume.md#knowledge-space) and developing software to surface information from data.
Given any problem space, my hope is to be part of the solution.
My aspiration is to improve health-care delivery by harnessing my skills.

##### Siemens Names 2011 ‘Most Inspired’ Healthcare Providers
United Health Services, , used Siemens  Decision Support Solutions (DSS) to help reduce hospital readmissions from 9 percent in 2009 to 6 percent in 2011. DSS tools,  such  as stored procedures and integration services, were used to calculate a LACE (Length of stay, Acuity, Co-morbid conditions, previous  Emergency  department visits) score for each patient. Scores were then compiled in reports which helped to focus the attention of nursing unit care managers on the patients at highest risk. This helped remind care managers to provide education, post-discharge instructions and medication management instructions[...see more](http://www.evaluategroup.com/Universal/View.aspx?type=Story&id=311705
