# Setup Cloudflare Tunnels to your home serve
Everything you need to know to get securely connect to your locally hosted application over the internet in under 30 mins.

![](/img/cloudflare_tunnel/cloudflare_tunnel.svg)


At the high level, I'm running a SimpleHTTPServer locally, that i want to access over the internet from https://home.mydomainname.com

Secondly, I'll lock down the access to this URL to whitelisted email addresses.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you:

+ [Add a website to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/setup/add-site/).
+ [Change your domain nameservers to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/setup/add-site/)

## Local

- in this POC i'm running a SimpleHTTPServer to surface the Director listing of a folder
- python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 65000


## Setup `cloudflared`

### Download

`wget -q https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb`

### install
`dpkg -i cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb`

### Authenticate
```
cloudflared tunnel login
```

## Setup tunnel

### create credential file
`cloudflared tunnel create <NAME>`
this will spit out a `<UUID>.json` file in your `~/.clouflared` DIR

### create config.yml
```
tunnel: <Tunnel-UUID>
credentials-file: /root/.cloudflared/<Tunnel-UUID>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: home.mydomainname.com
    service: http://localhost:65000
  - service: http_status:400
```

### Add DNS to route traffic to tunnel
- cloudflared tunnel route dns 856e737a-1b47-4037-9e3c-1f1c7a18eeab robinvarghese.com
- cloudflared tunnel run <NAME>

### run the tunnel
`cloudflared tunnel run <UUID or NAME>`

### verify
visiting the URL now should route traffic to your local service

Note:

## Secure you application
[Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) determines who can reach your application by applying the Access policies you configure.

Cloudflare Zero Trust integrates with your organizationâ€™s identity provider to apply Zero Trust and Secure Web Gateway policies.

In this example, I'm using As an alternative to configuring an identity provider, Cloudflare Zero Trust can send a [one-time PIN (OTP)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/one-time-pin/) to approved email addresses.

### Create [Access Group](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/users/groups/)
A group is a set of rules that can be configured once and then quickly applied across many Access applications

### Create [Access Policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/policy-management/)
An Access policy consists of an Action as well as rules which determine the scope of the action.

### Verify
visiting the URL now should present you with a [login page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/login-page/)

### Security Monitoring

You can monitor traffic in **Analytics & Logs** from the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
