I'm one part [</>](https://github.com/codein/)coder , one part üîçanalyst  and a hell lot of ‚ùìcuriosity.

Whatever the problem i like to be part of the solution.

I thrive in an environment of uncertainty & constant learning.

I enjoy empowering others in my [knowledge space](blog/resume/#knowledge-space) and developing software to surface information from data.
